So the last time I had Covid, (that I was aware of it and tested positive) was late December 2020 early January 2021.
Post-COVID I've been started on blood pressure meds, migraine meds, tripled my anxiety/depression meds, take two different types of inhalers, have severe brain fog and still very forgetful.
I had Covid 19 back end of Aug.
I have long haulers, I got covid August 23rd. It’s been such a long slow recovery.
I was warned since I did not do well when having Covid I would probably feel sick and down for a couple days and I sure did.
I had the delta strain, severe covid with pneumonia.
I’m 33 and a few illnesses but just got through covid for the 2nd time with no vaccines at all.
Well I tested positive again.
The first time I had it I got covid double pneumonia and I really thought I was going to die but thanks to Jesus it wasn't my time.
I have covid for 12th day.
I had COVID for about 2 weeks in Sept.
I’m vaccinated but no booster and I just tested positive for Covid.
