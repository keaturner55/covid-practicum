I contracted covid in Nov and I truly understand where coming from as I to was hospitalised , lost a lot of weight and was out of action for some time.
So the last time I had Covid, (that I was aware of it and tested positive) was late December 2020 early January 2021.
Still on oxygen 1yr 1mth.
I have covid for 12th day.
Itâ€™s been 7 months since Covid
