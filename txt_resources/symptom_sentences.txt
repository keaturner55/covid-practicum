When I call in to work because my blood pressure is high because of my migraines making me feel dizzy and nauseous.
Post-COVID I've been started on blood pressure meds, migraine meds, tripled my anxiety/depression meds, take two different types of inhalers, have severe brain fog and still very forgetful.
I contracted covid in Nov and I truly understand where coming from as I to was hospitalised , lost a lot of weight and was out of action for some time.
I struggle to breathe.
